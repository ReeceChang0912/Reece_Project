This repository is about major direction which i have great interest. They are front-edge and machine learning. 

In my way of exploration, I tried  original Js and then  React , mini-program. They are all started by inspiration flashes in my head.

Somehow I think in the future they will combine together, then everydocy can simply write a webUI by dragging based on  good training models
